# Python-Virus-Building-Simulation-
## This  python file demonstrates a simulation in which people form a building are struck with a deadly virus. 

using the package matplolib, I've learned tutorials on graphing with matplotlib and this python file demonstrates a simulation in which people form a building are struck with a deadly virus. Using python classes I was about to initialize the peoples data and status of their current state due to the virus and created subplot of four in which graphs their current state from healthy, sick, recovered, and dead.
